Each attempt is a progression of the last one. Each time I Googled more about unsupervised datasets, how to improve correlation, or different models to use, I updated the files.
I also made a helper file to get the correlation between the columns with the target column 'Corrucystic Density'.
The best outputs I got were with attempts 8 and 11.
The attempt 8 file wasn't submitted because for 30% of the dataset, it was showing a lower accuracy. But it was showing an RMSE score of 189.784 for the whole data.
