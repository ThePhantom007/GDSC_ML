Each attempt is a progression of the last one. Each time I Googled more about unsupervised datasets, how to improve correlation, or different models to use, I updated the files.
I also made a helper file to get the correlation between the columns with the target column 'Corrucystic Density'.
The best outputs I got were with attempts 11 and 12.
